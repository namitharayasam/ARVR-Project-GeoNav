## **How It Works**

1. **2D Map Interaction**: Users start by exploring a **2D map** (powered by **MapTiler**) where they can click on any location (latitude, longitude).
   
2. **Instant 3D Transition**: Upon clicking, the map transitions to a **3D view** of that location. The 3D model of the area is loaded, giving users a more immersive view of the terrain, buildings, and streets.

3. **Exploring the Space**: In the 3D view, users can navigate the space to explore specific entities like buildings, streets, or other significant geographic features. The 3D environment is interactive, with smooth transitions and dynamic lighting to enhance the user experience.

4. **Zoom & Interact**: Zoom in to get a street-level view and interact with entities like buildings and structures to explore the detailed architecture and spatial layout.
